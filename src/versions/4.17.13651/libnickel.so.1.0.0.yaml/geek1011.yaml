  # 0x4218BC is the offset of QVariant::toBool, which is called after getting
  # the setting (of if it has/should show) as a QVariant. I am replacing this
  # method as opposed to replacing the return value of the function for 1. A
  # MOV instruction with an immediate (fixed) value is 4 long (rather than 2)
  # and 2. This is simpler to update as I only need to update the function
  # offset and the offset for each setting.

      from .kobo/screensaver (note that full-screen covers needs to be enabled

  - ReplaceBytesNOP: {Offset: 0xA28228, FindBLX: 0x452DC4}

Remove title from reading header/footer:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: Removes the chapter/book title from the new reading header/footer.
  # In the longest form of ReadingFooter::update (the others are wrappers with
  # the args being set to the current value), the first one is the title. The
  # final string is created by starting with the title, then appending the "-",
  # then the page number / percentage / etc text.
  #
  # This one is slightly unusual in that the reading header also shares the
  # ReadingFooter code (ReadingView::updateProgressHeader only has the page text,
  # and it ends with a branch to ReadingFooter::update). This means we only have
  # to patch one place, but it also means you can't have the title in one, but
  # not the other.
  #
  # We'll patch this in a slightly hacky and inefficient, but simple and easy-to-update
  # way by replacing the first QString::append (the dash) with a QString::resize
  # to zero (I would have done a QString::clear, but that symbol isn't imported):
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xB6D00E, FindH: F9 68, ReplaceH: 00 21} # replace LDR r1, [...] with MOV r1, #0 (the LDR doesn't matter, but will need to be updated)
  - ReplaceBLX: {Offset: 0xB6D012, Find: 0x4503D8, Replace: 0x430DC8}

Larger Sleep/Power-off timeouts:
  - Enabled: no
  - PatchGroup: Sleep/Power-off timeouts
  - Description: |
      Increase the available sleep/power-off timeouts to larger values (up to a
      few weeks). To customize this patch, see https://pgaskin.net/kobopatch-patches/lgrpwroff-12920.html .

      IMPORTANT - Although this patch has been tested by multiple users and
      confirmed to be working, the interaction between the RTC timer and Nickel
      has many moving parts. As reported by JSWolf on MR, this patch might have
      issues with actually powering-off with timeouts longer than a day. The
      cause is likely to be the auto-sync interval or sleepcover causing the
      timer to be overridden/reset every day. Nevertheless, this patch should
      work reliably for timeouts under 12 hours, and probably under 1 day.

      If you are using this patch with timeouts above 12 hours, and can confirm
      if it works/doesn't work, please PM me or comment on GitHub with your
      setting values, sleepcover or not, auto-sync interval, wifi on/off, firmware
      version, and Kobo model.

      See https://github.com/geek1011/kobopatch-patches/issues/28#issuecomment-537161827
