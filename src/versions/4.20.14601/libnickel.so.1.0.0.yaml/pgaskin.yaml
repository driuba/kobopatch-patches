  - Description: Make both page turn sides go next in the reader.
  # In ReadingView::processTap(TapGesture*):
  # nop the branch for checking if left-to-right (so it always runs the swap of back/forward)
  - ReplaceBytesNOP: {Offset: 0xB19EAE, FindH: 18 B9}
  # where r3 = *(r7+0x18) (back) and r2 = *(r7+0x20) (forward), then they are stored in reverse,

  # This patch could have also been done later on where the tap point is checked against different
  # QRects, but that's a lot more complicated due to the use of QHash s of pointers to functions.

  # Replace the immediate value for the cmp r1, #2 before the bgt to the inlined
  # QVector::removeFirst() (i e. QVector::erase(start, start+1)):
  - BaseAddress: "BookmarkHistoryMixin::pushBookmark(Bookmark const&)"
  - ReplaceInt: {Offset: 18, Find: 2, Replace: 4} # note: you can set thr replacement to whatever you want, but it MUST be > 1 or bad things will happen

      screen one.

Allow USB storage even when device locked:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Always allows USB storage even when the device is locked. When combined
      with an enabled lock screen, this patch allows recovery from almost any
      segfaulting patch without a factory reset, as most code isn't executed
      until after the initial unlock. WARNING - this patches renders the lock
      screen security completely useless! But, for some security by obscurity
      this will only take effect when you plug it in while the sleep screen is
      visible.
  # Never reject the permission request (i.e. don't set *r5 = false), even when
  # the PIN entry dialog is enabled:

  - ReplaceBLX: {Offset: 0xBB2E20, Find: 0x4BE9E8, Replace: 0x4BBD6C}

Disable all tutorial dialogs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Removes the annoying tutorials (and recurring dialogs). Note - I may
      have missed a few of them. If I have, just open an issue on GitHub or
      PM me (geek1011) on MobileRead, and I'll fix it.
  # 0x4B555C is the offset of QVariant::toBool, which is called after getting
  # the setting (of if it has/should show) as a QVariant. I am replacing this
  # method as opposed to replacing the return value of the function for 1. A
  # MOV instruction with an immediate (fixed) value is 4 long (rather than 2)
  # and 2. This is simpler to update as I only need to update the function
  # offset and the offset for each setting.

## Change Browse Kobo home screen link target ###
# This patch allows you to change the target of the Browse Kobo link. To
# rename the top description, use the rename home screen footer patch.
#
# The easy options for this patch are fairly limited, as BrowseKoboWidget::tapped
# just calls the superclass event, then the call to DiscoverNavMixin::storeFront
# in the PLT is tail-call optimized. This places a number of restrictions on the
# replacement target, namely: the branch must be a branch and exchange, but not
# link (lr must be unchanged to return correctly), which is implemented as a
# 32-bit branch to a bx pc (nop branch, but still switch instruction sets)
# immediately before a PLT entry to a nav mixin without any arguments (i.e.
# must be static). Note that the first branch is relative to pc. Also, note that
# in general, tbis requirement means anything called by StatusBarController (the
# menu) can be used as a replacement.
#
# Basically, the following two steps are needed:
# - In BrowseKoboWidget::tapped, change the tail-call to the bx before
#   [something]NavMixin::[something] in the PLT.
# - In the BrowseKoboWidget constructor, change which function is called to get
#   the bottom text (Shop Kobo) from N3DeviceCharm::shopName (Shop Kobo / Walmart)
#   to N3DeviceCharm::[something] (note that there isn't enough room to
#   load an entirely different string here).

### Hide top-left menu items ###
# This following patches take advantage of the parental controls feature, as
# StatusBarMenuController::updateParentControlSensitiveMenuItems is always
# called when setting them up. All that is needed to hide items is to hardcode
# false before calling QAction::setVisible ([XX 46] mov r1, XX -> [00 21] movs r1, #0).
# To prevent ghost items, the value which stores the number of items to draw
# also needs to be fixed before the ldrex/strex just after the setVisible.

# Note for updating:
# It's just the r1 before QAction::setVisible and after
# QWidgetAction::defaultWidget for each widget name.

Allow showing info panel on random screensaver:

  - ReplaceBytesNOP: {Offset: 0xB07F38, FindBLX: 0x4EA30C}

Remove title from reading header/footer:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: Removes the chapter/book title from the new reading header/footer.
  # In the longest form of ReadingFooter::update (the others are wrappers with
  # the args being set to the current value), the first one is the title. The
  # final string is created by starting with the title, then appending the "-",
  # then the page number / percentage / etc text.
  #
  # This one is slightly unusual in that the reading header also shares the
  # ReadingFooter code (ReadingView::updateProgressHeader only has the page text,
  # and it ends with a branch to ReadingFooter::update). This means we only have
  # to patch one place, but it also means you can't have the title in one, but
  # not the other.
  #
  # We'll patch this in a slightly hacky and inefficient, but simple and easy-to-update
  # way by replacing the first QString::append (the dash) with a QString::resize
  # to zero (I would have done a QString::clear, but that symbol isn't imported):
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xC576CC, FindH: F9 68, ReplaceH: 00 21} # replace LDR r1, [...] with MOV r1, #0 (the LDR doesn't matter, but will need to be updated)

Larger Sleep/Power-off timeouts:
  - Enabled: no
  - PatchGroup: Sleep/Power-off timeouts
  - Description: |
      Increase the available sleep/power-off timeouts to larger values (up to a
      few weeks). To customize this patch, see https://pgaskin.net/kobopatch-patches/lgrpwroff-14601.html .

      IMPORTANT - Although this patch has been tested by multiple users and
      confirmed to be working, the interaction between the RTC timer and Nickel
      has many moving parts. As reported by JSWolf on MR, this patch might have
      issues with actually powering-off with timeouts longer than a day. The
      cause is likely to be the auto-sync interval or sleepcover causing the
      timer to be overridden/reset every day. Nevertheless, this patch should
      work reliably for timeouts under 12 hours, and probably under 1 day.

      If you are using this patch with timeouts above 12 hours, and can confirm
      if it works/doesn't work, please PM me or comment on GitHub with your
      setting values, sleepcover or not, auto-sync interval, wifi on/off, firmware
      version, and Kobo model.

Allow rotation on all devices:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Enables rotation on all devices. This shows a rotation icon in the status
      bar, which shows a menu allowing you to choose between portrait and landscape
      when pressed. This icon is only shown on rotateable views (like the reader).

Swap reading header/footer:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Swaps the reading header/footer text (i.e. book progress on top, chapter
      progress on the bottom). This patch has undefined behaviour if the header
      or footer is disabled.
  # Both the header and footer use the ReadingFooter class and update them using
  # the overloaded ReadingFooter::update function. The difference is which r0 (this)
  # is passed to them. Since tbe header and footer are both members of ReadingView,
  # and they are loaded just before the update (and aren't used otherwise), they
  # can be swapped by switching the struct offset used by LDR.
  #
  # Offsets (as of 4.19.14123):
  #  - ReadingView->header - 0x10
  #  - ReadingView->footer - 0x1C

Customize ComfortLight settings:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Change the times available in the ComfortLight bedtime dropdown and the
      start/end times for the color changes. All values in this patch are
      customizable.

      The default values for this patch give you 21 options between 5PM and 3AM
      at 30 minute intervals, with the colour change starting at 4PM, and the
      change back to blue between 5AM and 7AM. The firmware default is 13 options
      between 9PM-3AM at 30 minute intervals, with the transition starting at 6PM.
  ##
  # In an unnamed subroutine two layers into FrontLightPopupController::loadView
  # (find it by going back from QTime::addSecs), the times for the dropdown are
  # generated into a QVector<QPair<QString, QTime>> with a simple loop.

  # ARM assembler to change this value):
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xA904E2, FindH: 4F F4 E1 61, ReplaceH: 4F F4 E1 61} # mov.w r1, #1800: 30m
  #
  # Change the number of increments / bedtime dropdown options (start at the
  # initial time, add this number -1 more items with the above increment each
  # time) (movs r5, #13):
  - ReplaceInt: {Offset: 0xA904B6, Find: 13, Replace: 21} # 13 [9PM..3AM]+30m -> 21 [5PM..3AM]+30m
  #
  # Change the number of pre-allocated elements (I don't think this is actually
  # required, as Qt will realloc as necessary, but we might as well do this just
  # in case) (mov r1, #21):
  - ReplaceInt: {Offset: 0xA90720, Find: 13, Replace: 21} # same as prev replacement
  ##
  # The actual color adjustment is done in BedtimeManager::adjustTemperature.
  # The color temperature is based on the current time, the bedtime, the hardcoded
  # sunset, the hardcoded sunrise start, the hardcoded sunrise end, the daytime
  # temperature, and the nighttime temperature.
  #
  # Change the sunset time (the transition to a warmer temperature starts here
  # and transitions until the bedtime chosen) (this should be 1-3 hours before
  # the minimum bedtime from the first replacement above) (mov r1, #18):
  - ReplaceInt: {Offset: 0xA88F72, Find: 18, Replace: 16} # 18:00 (9PM-3=6PM) -> 16:00 (5PM-1=4PM)
  #
  # Change the time for the sunset timer to fire at (this is passed to a QTime
  # constructor which is passed to PowerTime::fireAt) (mov r1, #18):
  - ReplaceInt: {Offset: 0xA8908A, Find: 18, Replace: 16} # should match the sunset time above
  #
  # Optional: Change the sunrise start time (the transition back to a cooler
  # temperature starts here) (this should be sometime after the last bedtime,
  # but before the sunset time) (mov r1, #5):
  - ReplaceInt: {Offset: 0xA88F94, Find: 5, Replace: 5} # 5AM
  #
  # Optional: Change the sunrise end time (the transition back to a cooler
  # temperature ends here) (this should be 1-3 hours after the sunrise start but
  # before the sunset time or bad things will happen with negative values) (mov r1, #7):
  - ReplaceInt: {Offset: 0xA88F5E, Find: 7, Replace: 7} # 5AM+2=7AM
