Set slide to unlock:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Swipe to unlock is enabled by default for the Kobo Forma. This patch allows
      you to enable/disable swipe to unlock for any device.
  # In the subroutine where the AbstractPowerView (used for swipe to unlock) is instantiated:
  # pre-4.11.12111: change Device::isFrost() to a MOV instruction to set true/false
  # 4.11.12111+: change PowerSettings::getUnlockEnabled() (to override the hidden config setting [PowerSettings] -> UnlockEnabled)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xA09E0C, FindBLX: 0x43E0AC, ReplaceH: 4F F0 01 00}
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xA09E0E, FindH: 01, ReplaceH: 00} # 00 to disable, 01 to enable

Enable rotation on all devices:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Enables rotation on all devices. This shows a rotation icon in the status
      bar, which shows a menu allowing you to choose between portrait and landscape
      when pressed. This icon is only shown on rotateable views (like the reader).
  # This patch is not necessary anymore since 4.13.12638, as there is a fully
  # working config setting (ForceAllowLandscape in the DeveloperSettings section)
  # now, but is being kept for backwards compatibility with old kobopatch configs
  # and for convenience.
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0x673156, FindBLX: 0x416230, ReplaceH: 4F F0 01 00}

Both page turn buttons go next:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Make both page turn buttons on the Forma go next in the reader.
  # In ReadingView::keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent*):
  # nop the possible branch to prev page, falling through to the next page no matter what.
  - ReplaceBytesNOP: {Offset: 0xA134F8, FindH: 2E B1}

Both page turn sides go next:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Make both page turn sides go next in the reader.
  # In ReadingView::processTap(TapGesture*):
  # nop the branch for checking if left-to-right (so it always runs the swap of back/forward)
  - ReplaceBytesNOP: {Offset: 0xA1A860, FindH: 18 B9}
  # where r3 = *(r7+0xc) (back) and r2 = *(r7+0x18) (forward), then they are stored in reverse,
  # instead of storing each one, just store forward (by changing the source register in the str
  # instruction)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xA1A866, FindH: BB 61, ReplaceH: BA 61}
  # This patch could have also been done later on where the tap point is checked against different
  # QRects, but that's a lot more complicated due to the use of QHash s of pointers to functions.

      patch works well with the "Custom menubar - reduce height by 33%" patch.

  - ReplaceBLX: {Offset: 0xAAD268, Find: 0x41EBE8, Replace: 0x41C2B0}

Disable all tutorial dialogs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Removes the annoying tutorials (and recurring dialogs). Note - I may
      have missed a few of them. If I have, just open an issue on GitHub or
      PM me (geek1011) on MobileRead, and I'll fix it.
  # 0x416230 is the offset of QVariant::toBool, which is called after getting
  # the setting (of if it has/should show) as a QVariant. I am replacing this
  # method as opposed to replacing the return value of the function for 1. A
  # MOV instruction with an immediate (fixed) value is 4 long (rather than 2)
  # and 2. This is simpler to update as I only need to update the function
  # offset and the offset for each setting.
