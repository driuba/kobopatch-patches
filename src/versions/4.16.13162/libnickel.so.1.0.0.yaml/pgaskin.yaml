Set slide to unlock:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Swipe to unlock is enabled by default for the Kobo Forma. This patch allows
      you to enable/disable swipe to unlock for any device.
  # In the subroutine where the AbstractPowerView (used for swipe to unlock) is instantiated:
  # pre-4.11.12111: change Device::isFrost() to a MOV instruction to set true/false
  # 4.11.12111+: change PowerSettings::getUnlockEnabled() (to override the hidden config setting [PowerSettings] -> UnlockEnabled)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xA17540, FindBLX: 0x4444CC, ReplaceH: 4F F0 01 00}
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xA17542, FindH: 01, ReplaceH: 00} # 00 to disable, 01 to enable

Enable rotation on all devices:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Enables rotation on all devices. This shows a rotation icon in the status
      bar, which shows a menu allowing you to choose between portrait and landscape
      when pressed. This icon is only shown on rotateable views (like the reader).
  # This patch is not necessary anymore since 4.13.12638, as there is a fully
  # working config setting (ForceAllowLandscape in the DeveloperSettings section)
  # now, but is being kept for backwards compatibility with old kobopatch configs
  # and for convenience.

  - ReplaceBytesNOP: {Offset: 0xA20A90, FindH: 2E B1}

Both page turn sides go next:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Make both page turn sides go next in the reader.
  # In ReadingView::processTap(TapGesture*):
  # nop the branch for checking if left-to-right (so it always runs the swap of back/forward)
  - ReplaceBytesNOP: {Offset: 0xA27CE0, FindH: 18 B9}
  # where r3 = *(r7+0xc) (back) and r2 = *(r7+0x18) (forward), then they are stored in reverse,
  # instead of storing each one, just store forward (by changing the source register in the str
  # instruction)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xA27CE6, FindH: BB 61, ReplaceH: BA 61}
  # This patch could have also been done later on where the tap point is checked against different
  # QRects, but that's a lot more complicated due to the use of QHash s of pointers to functions.

Disable all tutorial dialogs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Removes the annoying tutorials (and recurring dialogs). Note - I may
      have missed a few of them. If I have, just open an issue on GitHub or
      PM me (geek1011) on MobileRead, and I'll fix it.
  # 0x41C23C is the offset of QVariant::toBool, which is called after getting
  # the setting (of if it has/should show) as a QVariant. I am replacing this
  # method as opposed to replacing the return value of the function for 1. A
  # MOV instruction with an immediate (fixed) value is 4 long (rather than 2)
  # and 2. This is simpler to update as I only need to update the function
  # offset and the offset for each setting.

Allow showing info panel on random screensaver:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      See https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=321609. This patch
      allows showing the info panel even when using a random screensaver image
      from .kobo/screensaver (note that full-screen covers needs to be enabled
      for the screensaver to show).
  - ReplaceBytesNOP: {Offset: 0xA17E9C, FindBLX: 0x44D564}

Larger Sleep/Power-off timeouts:
  - Enabled: no
  - PatchGroup: Sleep/Power-off timeouts
  - Description: |
      Increase the available sleep/power-off timeouts to larger values (up to a
      few weeks). To customize this patch, see https://pgaskin.net/kobopatch-patches/lgrpwroff-12920.html .

      IMPORTANT - Although this patch has been tested by multiple users and
      confirmed to be working, the interaction between the RTC timer and Nickel
      has many moving parts. As reported by JSWolf on MR, this patch might have
      issues with actually powering-off with timeouts longer than a day. The
      cause is likely to be the auto-sync interval or sleepcover causing the
      timer to be overridden/reset every day. Nevertheless, this patch should
      work reliably for timeouts under 12 hours, and probably under 1 day.

      If you are using this patch with timeouts above 12 hours, and can confirm
      if it works/doesn't work, please PM me or comment on GitHub with your
      setting values, sleepcover or not, auto-sync interval, wifi on/off, firmware
      version, and Kobo model.

      See https://github.com/pgaskin/kobopatch-patches/issues/28#issuecomment-537161827
